# IMS-Starter

The project is a inventory management system, it is built to allow you to control and store data on customers, orders and items. 

## Getting Started

Clone down the repository through your gitbash command line, using the command "git clone $https://github.com/KugananK/IMS-Starter.git" 

This will allow you to create a local repository of the code.

Using this you can launch it in eclipse or any other JRE.

Change the database location to your own, signing in to your own with your own username and password found in src/main/resources/db.properties

Then run using the runner class in order to utilise the IMS
